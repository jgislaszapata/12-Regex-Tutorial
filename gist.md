# 17-Regex Tutorial 

## Summary 

A **regex**, or **regular expression**, is a sequence of characters that defines a specific search pattern. The regex in this tutorial is used to match an HTML tag. When included in code or search algorithms, regular expressions can be used to find certain patterns of characters within a string, or to find and replace a character or sequence of characters within a string. They are also frequently used to validate input. This tutorial will break down the regex's different components as shown in the table of contents.

This tutorial will cover the following regex:

 - Matching an Email: `/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/`

## Regex Components

## Anchors

This regex uses the `^` anchor to signify the beginning of the string and the `$` anchor to signify its ending. In the example above, the content of the email is contained withing the `^` near the beginning and ends with the `$` at the end. Note that the entire expression is contained within opening and closing forwardslashes `/`.
