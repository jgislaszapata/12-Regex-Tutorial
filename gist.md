# 17-Regex Tutorial 

## Summary 

A **regex**, or **regular expression**, is a sequence of characters that defines a specific search pattern. The regex in this tutorial is used to match an HTML tag. When included in code or search algorithms, regular expressions can be used to find certain patterns of characters within a string, or to find and replace a character or sequence of characters within a string. They are also frequently used to validate input. This tutorial will break down the regex's different components as shown in the table of contents.
